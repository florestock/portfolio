    <h2>Product Teaser Commercial</h2>
    <p>This project was a collaborative effort where our group produced a product teaser commercial, taking on different roles to bring the concept to life. Together we developed the shot list and filmed with a Blackmagic camera. We then edited the footage in Adobe Premiere Pro, learning to create seamless transitions and cuts. We selected and synced the music to amplify the emotional impact of the video. Working with my group allowed me to refine my technical skills in both camera work and video editing while coordinating efforts to meet a shared vision.</p>

    <h2>Think Twice Campaign Commercial</h2>
    <p>The goal of the Think Twice campaign was to create a campaign and advertisement targeting Gen-Z and Millennial audiences, particularly fashion enthusiasts interested in reducing environmental harm. Our team worked collaboratively on the project, which included mood board creation, drafting shot lists, and assisting in storyboarding. I also played an active role in filming, acting, and editing the footage in Adobe Premiere Pro, adding narration, sound effects, and music. We worked together to produce three different video formats for YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok to ensure cross-platform adaptability. The project took 55 hours, and we faced challenges like coordinating with strangers and perfecting the complex editing as a group.</p>

    <h2>Branding Strategy</h2>
    <p>For this branding strategy project, our team collaborated with a real client who sought to expand their reversible neck scarf product to a global market. Over the course of one week, we worked in a diverse team with classmates from Finland and the Czech Republic, combining insights from different cultural perspectives. Our goal was to develop a cohesive branding strategy that aligned with the client’s vision and positioned their product competitively in the global fashion industry.    </p>

    <h2>Diorama for Client</h2>
    <p>This diorama project involved creating a custom 3D model for a client using Blender. I worked closely with the client to understand their vision and translated their ideas into a virtual diorama. The model was animated using Blender’s camera features, which I learned during this project. The final product was rendered into a video, providing a comprehensive view of the diorama. The project not only honed my Blender skills but also deepened my ability to communicate with clients and bring abstract ideas to life.</p>
